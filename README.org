GNU make.
- It would now have created a =build= directory.
- To build it requires the following:
 - GNU emacs 24.x+
 - Org-mode version 8.2.10

* How to remove/reset the build
- To clean/remove the changes from the build run
=make clean=, which just removes the build directory, which can also
be done by =rm -rf build=.
